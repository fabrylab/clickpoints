Opening Files and Folders
=========================

ClickPoints was designed with multiple usage keys in mind, and therefore provides multiple ways to open files.

.. attention::
    Opening a set of files for the first time can take some time to extract time and meta information
    from the filename, TIFF or EXIF header. For large collections of files it is recommended to save the collection
    as a project and use the ``.cdb`` file for starting ClickPoints. Saving time as no file system search is necessary
    and all meta information is already stored in the ``.cdb``

via Interface
-------------
ClickPoints can be started empty by using a desktop link or terminal.
Images can be added to ClickPoints by using |the folder button|.


via Context Menu
----------------
A fast and comfortable way to open files and folders with ClickPoints is the context menu.


ClickPoints can be opened with various files as target:

-  an **image**, loading all images in the folder of the target image.
-  a **video** file, loading only this video.
-  a **folder**, loading all image and video files of the folder and its sub folders, which are concatenated to one single image stream.
-  a previously saved ``.cdb`` **ClickPoints Project** file, loading the project as it was saved.
