Track
=====

This addon takes markers in one image and tries to find the corresponding image parts in the subsequent images.

To use it, open a ClickPoints session and add the addon clicking on |the script icon|.

Mark every object which should be tracked with a marker of a type with TYPE_Track. Then hit ``F12`` (or the button you assigned the Track.py to) and watch the objects to be tracked. You can at any point hit the key again to stop the tracking. If the tracker has made errors, you can move the marker by hand and restart the tracking from the new position.
