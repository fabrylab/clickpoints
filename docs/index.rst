Welcome to the ClickPoints Documentation
========================================   

Click Points is a program written in the Python programming language, which serves on the one hand as an image viewer
and on the other hand as an data display and annotation tool. Every frame can be annotated by a description, marked
points/tracks, or marked areas (paint brush). This helps to view image data, do manual evaluation of data, help to create
semi-automatic evaluation or display the results of automatic image evaluation.

Citing ClickPoints
------------------

If you use ClickPoints for academic research, you are highly encouraged (though not
required) to cite the following paper:

*  Gerum, R., Richter, S., Fabry, B. and Zitterbart, D.P. (2016),
   `"ClickPoints: an expandable toolbox for scientific image annotation and analysis" <http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12702/abstract>`_.
   Methods Ecol Evol. doi:10.1111/2041-210X.12702

ClickPoints is developed primarily by academics, and so citations matter a lot to
us. Citing ClickPoints also increases it's exposure and potential user
(and developer) base, which is to the benefit of all users of ClickPoints. Thanks
in advance!
