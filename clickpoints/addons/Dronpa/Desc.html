<p>This add-on is an implementation of the evaluation of the flow of flourescence intensity from one cell to other cells.
Therefore the user can define regions in every image of a sequence by drawing masks. These masks define the region of the
cell that is visible in the image. From this region the green image channel will be summed as the total flourescence
    intensity of the cell at this time.</p>

<p>To calculate the flow, adjacent cells where a diffusion should be calculated can be connected with the line marker of
    the type "connect". Then the evaluation can be started.</p>

<p>The output will show two plots of the intensities over time and the calculated diffusion compared to the measured concentration
change. The images along with the data will be stored in a folder called "output" in the location where the "*.cdb" file
    of the project has been saved.</p>
