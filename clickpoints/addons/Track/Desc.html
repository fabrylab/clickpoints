<p>This add-on takes markers in one image and tries to find the corresponding image parts in the subsequent images.</p>

<p>Create a marker type with mode <b>TYPE_Track</b>. Mark every object which should be tracked with a marker of this type.
Start the add-on and watch the objects to be tracked. You can at any point hit the key again to stop the tracking.
    If the tracker has made errors, you can move the marker by hand and restart the tracking from the new position.</p>

<p>The algorithm uses the current positions of the track and tries to find them in the next image using a sparse iterative
    Lucas-Kanade optical flow algorithm.</p>
