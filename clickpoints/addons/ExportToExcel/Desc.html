<p>This tool allows to export data from the ClickPoints database to an Excel file for further evaluations. While we still
recommend the use of the Python API, which is far more powerful for data extraction, this tool can help users that are
    not familiar with the Python programming language.</p>
<p>The following modes can be used to export the data:</p>

<h2>Marker Count</h2>
<p>This will create one line per image and one column per marker type. For each marker type the count of markers in this
    image are written to the cell.</p>

<p>This mode is useful, if only counts of the different marker types are of interest, e.g. how many animals were counted
in each image.</p>

<h2>Marker Positions</h2>
<p>This will create one line per image and one sheet per marker type. In each line, the marker x and y coordinates are
    written for the current image and marker type.</p>

<p>This mode is useful, if the position data of the markers is needed.</p>

<h2>Track Positions</h2>
<p>This will create one line per image and two columns per track. For each image and each track, the x and y positions
    of the track marker are exported, the cell is left blank, if there is no marker for this track in the current image.</p>
<p>This mode is useful, if the positional data of tracks is needed.</p>
